# Key-Detection-Android
Implementation of Key detection algorithms into an Android app (Group project for University of Science and Technology of Hanoi)

## Introduction 
The app was developed for the purpose of demonstrating the key detection algorithms that we wrote here: https://github.com/ZellNguyen/Key-Detection. The app was built based on Cepstral analysis algorithm.

## Note
Because it was not designed for the purpose of commercial usage, the app doesn't follow the design style guide of Android. But please feel free to clone and test it.
